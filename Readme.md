When you think of DDOS you think of a more complex situation where a hacker is using code to deny service from a provider, and that is not true
denying of service can be easily done using everyday applications for example if i run 100 web browsers trying to access a small business site that
web server from that small business is being put under huge loads of stress meaning any of their customers trying to access their site can lead to slow load times
or even no loading at all with a prompt Time out.

in this example i have a MSDOS script where the script will execute 20 browsers loading google.com the target and depending on the server we would have to run more
browsers requesting more resources to deny more service.
